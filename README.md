# ## Importing required libraries
# 
# ### `NumPy - for efficient matrix & vector operations.`
# ### `PyPlot - for plotting the graphs.`
# ### `SciPy - for efficient scientific operation & computation.`

# ### NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# ### Pyplot is a Matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface. 
# ### Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python and the advantage of being free and open-source.

# ### SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
